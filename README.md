# ARPong, UCLA CS M117 group project

A multiplayer Augmented Reality game of the classic game PONG, using Unity, Google ARCore, and Google Cloud Anchor API

Unity - used to script game mechanics along with scripts for network managers for API and direct wireless connection

Google ARCore - engine library used to place local(augmented field) coordinate on top of real coordinates, and place the game field on top

Google Cloud Anchor API - "anchored" the augmented field on real world field, which allowed sharing of synchronized local-to-real coordinate systems between two phones, allowing the augmented game field to have same positional and directional values relative to the real world
